=====================================
******* DEPRECATED REPOSITORY *******
=====================================
This repository has reached its EOL and has been deprecated and will be publicly removed in September 2023. Users will still be able to download the latest version under demand by sending a request message to support@ftrack.com.

We highly encourage our users to use the new integrations framework which supports the latest versions of the most used DCC and is much easier to customize and extend.
You can find the latest downloadable version of the framework in the plugin manager of ftrack connect https://go.ftrack.com/connect-download.

Framework documentation: https://ftrackhq.github.io/integrations/libs/framework-core/

All our maintained code is now under a monorepo repository that as of the date of this message (26/05/2023) is still private as we are still doing some migration and setup jobs. We are working hard to open it publicly as soon as we can. You will be able to find the monorepo at: https://github.com/ftrackhq/integrations.

Don't hesitate on contact our support team if you have any inquiries: support@ftrack.com
